(X/x)---(Y/y)---(Z/z)--(A/a)---N-\n
X---Y---Z---A---N-\n


(X/x): the x-value of the camera relative to target in cm. Lowercase x denotes negative. From calculation to robot, -z -> x
(Y/y): the z-value of the camera relative to target in cm. Lowercase y denotes negative. From calculation to robot, x -> y
(Z/z): the y-value of the camera relative to target in cm. Lowercase z denotes negative. From calculation to robot, y -> z
(A/a): angle in degrees. Lowercase a denotes negative. From calculation to robot, angle[1] -> angle
N: the number of targets found
Numbers are padded with zeroes

If it cannot decide on a target or none found: FN-\n.\
